# NAME

Locale::Maketext::Test

# VERSION

Version 0.01

# SYNOPSIS

    use Locale::Maketext::Test;

    my $foo = Locale::Maketext::Test->new(directory => '/tmp/locales');

    ### optional parameters
    # languages => ['en', 'de'] - to test specific languages in directory, else it will pick all po files in directory
    # debug     => 1 - if you want to check warnings add debug flag else it will output errors only

    # start test
    my $response = $foo->testlocales();

    # no errors or warnings if
    $response->{status} eq 1;

    # something is wrong when
    $response->{status} eq 0;

    # check for errors and warnings in case status is 0
    $response->{errors} = {id => [error1, error2], ru => [error1, error2]};
    # warnings are only present when debug is set to 1
    $response->{warnings} = {id => [warn1, warn2], ru => [warn1, warn2]};

# DESCRIPTION

This reads all message ids from the specified PO files and tries to
translate them into the destination language. PO files can be specified either
as file name (extension .po) or by providing the language. In the latter case
the PO file is found in the directory given by the directory option.

## TYPES OF ERRORS FOUND

### unknown %func() calls

Translations can contain function calls in the form of %func(parameters).
These functions must be defined in our code. Sometimes translators try
to translate the function name which then calls an undefined function.

### incorrect number of %plural() parameters

Different languages have different numbers of plural forms.
Some, like Malay, don't have any plural forms. Some, like English or French,
have just 2 forms, singular and one plural. Others like Arabic or Russian have
more forms. Whenever a translator uses the %plural() function, he must specify
the correct number of plural forms as parameters.

### incorrect usage of %d in %plural() parameters

In some languages, like English or German, singular is applicable only to the
quantity of 1. That means the German translator could come up for instance
with the following valid %plural call:

    %plural(%5,ein Stein,%d Steine)

In other languages, like French or Russian, this would be an error. French uses
singular also for 0 quantities. So, if the French translator calls:

    %plural(%5,une porte,%d portes)

and in the actual call the quantity of 0 is passed the output is still "une porte".
In Russian the problem is even more critical because singular is used for instance
also for the quantity of 121.

Thus, this test checks if a) the target language is similar to English in having only
2 plural forms, singular and one plural, and in applying singular only to the quantity
of 1. If both of these conditions are met %plural calls like the above are allowed.
Otherwise, if at least one of the parameters passed to %plural contains a %d,
all of the parameters must contain the %d as well.

That means the following 2 %plural calls are allowed in Russian:

    %plural(%3,%d книга,%d книги,%d книг)
    %3 %plural(%3,книга,книги,книг)

while this is forbidden:

    %plural(%3,одна книга,%d книги,%d книг)

# SUBROUTINES/METHODS

## debug

set this if you need to check warnings along with errors

## directory

directory where locales files are located

## languages

language array, set this if you want to test specific language only

## BUILD

## testlocales

test po files in directory specified

This returns hash with status, errors and warnings

    {
        status   => 1/0, # 1 is success, 0 failure
        errros   => [errro1, errro2],
        warnings => [warn1, warn2]
    }
